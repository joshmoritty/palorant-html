            <h2>New Maps: Flakor and Binti</h2>
            <p>
              This patch also introduces two new maps, each offering unique
              challenges and opportunities:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Flakor:</strong> Set in a bustling, neon-lit city, this
              map combines narrow alleyways with wide open spaces perfect for
              ambushes and tactical plays. Verticality is key here, as players
              can access rooftops to gain an advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Binti:</strong> A desolate, post-apocalyptic arena
              featuring sprawling dunes, crumbling structures, and limited
              cover. Use the environment to your advantage in this map's
              dynamic, high-risk engagements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both maps are now part of the competitive and unranked rotations,
              so jump in and explore!
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to new content, Patch 3.0 brings several
              quality-of-life updates and balance changes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Agent Tweaks:</strong> Adjustments to improve balance
                for several agents, including buffs for Phoenix and nerfs to
                Chamber.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ranked Updates:</strong> Improved matchmaking to ensure
                fairer matches and better progression through the ranks.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Audio Enhancements:</strong> Updated sound design for
                better spatial awareness in-game.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bug Fixes:</strong> Resolved issues with map clipping,
                ability hitboxes, and server stability.

            </ul>
            <p>
              We've also implemented general optimizations to ensure smoother
              performance across all platforms.
