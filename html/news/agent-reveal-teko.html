            <h2>An Offer You Can't Refuse</h2>
            <p>
              Agents, the PALORANT Protocol has a new wildcard—meet Teko, a
              cunning initiator with a penchant for manipulation and control.
              Inspired by the underworld's calculated power plays, Teko’s
              abilities are designed to sow chaos, mislead opponents, and create
              opportunities for their team to capitalize on. This shadowy
              operator is here to change the game, one clever move at a time.
            </p>

            <h2>A Deceptive Skillset</h2>
            <p>
              Teko’s abilities focus on disrupting enemy plans and controlling
              the flow of engagements. Here’s a closer look at what they bring
              to the battlefield:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Smoke Bargain:</strong> Deploy a deceptive smoke that
                expands and contracts erratically, obscuring vision and
                disorienting enemies within it. Use it to block sightlines or
                confuse opponents in critical moments.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Marked Deal:</strong> Throw a tracking device that
                reveals enemy locations when it sticks to surfaces or players,
                acting as a constant thorn in their side.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Trade Secrets:</strong> Place a decoy that mimics Teko’s
                movements for a limited time. Enemies who shoot the decoy are
                briefly revealed on the map, exposing their position.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ultimate: Blackout Market:</strong> Create a localized
                area where enemy abilities are swapped randomly, leaving them
                scrambling to adapt to unfamiliar tools while your team strikes.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Teko’s kit rewards creative players who thrive on mind games,
              deception, and outsmarting their opponents.
            </p>

            <h2>The Mastermind’s Backstory</h2>
            <p>
              Hailing from a background of underground dealings and power
              struggles, Teko rose through the ranks by outthinking and
              outmaneuvering everyone in their path. With a mind for strategy
              and an aura of charisma, they’ve learned to play the long game,
              leveraging every situation to their advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
              After being recruited by the PALORANT Protocol, Teko now uses
              their skills for a greater cause, but their knack for bending the
              rules and crafting “offers you can’t refuse” remains as sharp as
              ever.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Changing the Meta</h2>
            <p>
              Teko brings a fresh take on how teams approach engagements. Their
              abilities encourage bold plays, misdirection, and turning the
              enemy’s strategy against them. Whether you’re baiting opponents
              into a trap, gathering intel, or disorienting foes, Teko opens up
              countless new possibilities for creative strategies.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Ready to Make a Deal?</h2>
            <p>
              Teko is now live in PALORANT! Take them into the battlefield and
              experience their unique approach to combat and control. As always,
              we can’t wait to see the incredible plays and strategies you
              create with this new agent.
            </p>
            <p>
              The question is: will you outsmart your opponents or fall victim
              to Teko’s cunning tactics? The choice is yours—if you dare.
