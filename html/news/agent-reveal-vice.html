            <h2>A New Era Begins with Vice</h2>
            <p>
              Greetings, Agents! The team at Giot Games is thrilled to introduce
              our latest addition to the PALORANT roster: Vice. This new agent
              embodies our commitment to delivering tactical depth and
              unforgettable gameplay experiences. Vice's kit is designed to
              empower players who thrive on strategy, coordination, and
              precision, ensuring their presence will redefine the battlefield.
            </p>

            <p>
              Vice represents a perfect fusion of cutting-edge technology and
              human ingenuity. With a sharp mind and an even sharper toolkit,
              Vice promises to be a game-changer for those who crave control and
              disruption. We couldn't be more excited to see how players adapt
              to this master tactician's potential in the evolving meta.
            </p>

            <h2>Abilities Designed for Tactical Excellence</h2>
            <p>
              Vice's abilities are carefully crafted to enhance strategic
              gameplay. The Tactical Override ability deploys an electromagnetic
              zone that disrupts enemy vision and temporarily disables their
              abilities within its radius. This tool is perfect for seizing
              control of key areas, forcing opponents to either retreat or face
              your team's wrath.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another cornerstone of Vice's kit is Recon Surge, a deployable
              drone that scans for enemies in a designated radius. This ability
              provides unparalleled intelligence, ensuring your team knows
              exactly where the threats are and can act accordingly. With these
              tools, Vice is perfectly suited for players who love to outthink
              and outmaneuver their opponents.
            </p>

            <h2>System Crash: The Game-Changer</h2>
            <p>
              Vice's ultimate ability, System Crash, is a momentous addition to
              PALORANT's tactical arsenal. When activated, it unleashes a
              powerful EMP blast that disables all enemy abilities and gadgets
              within a wide area. This momentary disruption can tip the balance
              of even the most heated matches.
            </p>
            <p>
              System Crash rewards precise timing and coordination. Whether
              you're breaking through a heavily defended site or neutralizing an
              enemy push, Vice's ultimate ensures your team has the upper hand
              when it matters most. We're excited to see how players use this
              powerful ability in creative and unexpected ways.
            </p>

            <h2>The Story Behind the Agent</h2>
            <p>
              Every agent in PALORANT brings a unique narrative, and Vice is no
              exception. Before joining the PALORANT Protocol, Vice was a
              brilliant tech engineer working for a powerful conglomerate.
              However, after uncovering unethical experiments that put countless
              lives at risk, Vice chose to expose the truth and walk away.
            </p>

              <img src="../../resources/img/news/vice/2.jpg" />
            </figure>
            <p>
              Armed with their technological expertise and driven by a sense of
              justice, Vice created their own gear to fight back. Their journey
              from engineer to agent showcases resilience and ingenuity, making
              them a compelling addition to the PALORANT lore. We believe Vice's
              story will resonate deeply with our community.
            </p>

          <section>
            <h2>Shaping the Future of PALORANT</h2>
            <p>
              Vice's arrival marks a turning point for PALORANT's gameplay
              ecosystem. With abilities that emphasize control, disruption, and
              teamwork, Vice is perfect for players who enjoy thinking several
              steps ahead. They bring a fresh layer of complexity that rewards
              strategic decision-making, making every round more dynamic and
              exciting.
            </p>
            <p>
              As developers, we constantly strive to expand the tactical
              possibilities in PALORANT. Vice embodies our vision of creating
              agents who push the boundaries of what's possible in competitive
              gameplay. We can't wait to see how you, our incredible community,
              utilize their abilities to craft new strategies and clutch
              unforgettable victories.
